    <p style="color: blueviolet;">Akirachix is a dream come for every poor girl child who wants to have a great life.My experience is both good and bad as explained below.</p>
    <h2 style="border: dotted 2px;">Good Things</h2>
    <ol>
<li>The aluminies are great in their teaching.</l1>
<li>The water used for showering is warm and healthy</li>
<li>The environment is very quiet and good for studies</li>
</ol>
<h3>Bad Things</h3>
<ul>
<li>The electricity sometimes goes off and we have no power to use for our activities</li>
<li>The cook serving food is alone sometimes and so time is wasted serving very many students,so we can't make it to class in time</li>
</ul>
